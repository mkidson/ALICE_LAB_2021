hey y'all so i've been trying to get this fileCaptureCont.py program working for the past 5 hours and it's looking like it's a massive problem with the OpenWave-1KB project, which is designed to interface with the oscilloscopes and should be able to extract the waveforms of the scintillator data, but i just cannot get it to work
